# Hangman

This project is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in JavaScript.  The user tries to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters one at a time.  They have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

## Installation

1. Save `hangman.js` and `index.html` in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.  (You can open it directly by double clicking or by using a local web server if you prefer).

## How to Play

1. The game will start by displaying underscores representing the hidden word.
2. Enter a single letter in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
4. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a guess.
5. You have a limited number of guesses (currently 6).
6. The game ends when you guess the word correctly or run out of guesses. The results will be displayed on the page.
